# Additional Tree Problems

I solved the majority of these problems very quickly using the BFS method I had learned from Binary Tree Level Order Traversal.
All that was required to solve most of these was to input some sort of conditional statement that met the unique condition of the problem in all of 
my implementations of BFS in these problems.

I have not checked and reviewed that all of the solutions contain the optimal solution, I just wanted to see how many problems
I could quickly solve given the new algorithm I had learned.

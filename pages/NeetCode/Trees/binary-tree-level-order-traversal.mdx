## Description 

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `false`  

## Optimal Solution

I learned how to implement Breadth First Search after reviewing the NeetCode solution for this problem.
I was able to solve other Tree problems that required Depth First Search on my own, but had to look up the solution for this one.
After reviewing NeetCode, I learned how to do BFS and found myself able to immediately solve seven other similar problems using this method,
which were:

* [Average of Levels in Binary Tree](./Additional_Problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree)
* [Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row](./Additional_Problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row)
* [Find Bottom Left Tree Value](./Additional_Problems/find-bottom-left-tree-value)
* [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](./Additional_Problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []

        queue = deque()
        result = []

        queue.append(root)
        while queue:
            current_result = []
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                curr = queue.popleft()
                current_result.append(curr.val)
                if curr.left:
                    queue.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    queue.append(curr.right)
            result.append(current_result)
        return result
```

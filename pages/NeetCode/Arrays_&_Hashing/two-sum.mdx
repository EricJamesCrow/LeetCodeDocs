## Description 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
**Output:** `[0,1]`  
**Explanation:** `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, so the indices returned are `[0,1]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  
**Explanation:** `nums[1] + nums[2] == 6`, so the indices returned are `[1,2]`.


## First Approach O(n<sup>2</sup>)

This was one of the very first LeetCode problems I attempted.
I figured this one out through trial and error. I did not have any sort of methodical approach at the time, so I was pretty proud of myself, especially since I was new to LeetCode.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for x in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i]+nums[x] == target:
                    return [i,x]
```

## Optimal Solution O(n)

After reviewing NeetCode, I learned how I could use hashing to make this problem run in O(n), which is an optimal solution.
I also learned how I can use enumerate to grab both the index and the value from an array.
I found this technique to be very helpful in solving similar problems.
First, you want to find the difference by subtracting the current number with the target.
Then, you check to see if the difference is in the hashmap.
If it is, then you know you have found the two numbers that make up the sum of the target, which means you can return the indexes of the those two numbers.
If the difference is not found, then you will add the current number and index to the hashmap, and then continue iterating through the array.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashMap = {}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in hashMap:
                return [hashMap[diff], index]
            hashMap[num] = index
        return
```

# Trees

Welcome to the Trees section of my LeetCode journey! Trees are a fundamental data structure used in computer science to represent hierarchical structures. They have various applications in databases, graphics, network algorithms, and more.

## Overview

A tree consists of nodes connected by edges. It has the following properties:

* **Root:** The top node in a tree.
* **Child:** A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
* **Parent:** The converse notion of a child.
* **Siblings:** Nodes with the same parent.
* **Leaf:** A node with no children.

Trees play a critical role in many algorithms and provide efficient solutions for various problems.

## Problems

# Arrays & Hashing

Welcome to the Arrays & Hashing section of my LeetCode journey! This part of the documentation represents an important step in understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms that form the building blocks of computer science.

## Overview

Arrays and Hashing are core concepts that are often used to solve a wide range of problems. They provide efficient ways to store, access, and manage data.

* **Arrays:** Arrays are sequential collections of elements. They allow for efficient access and modification of data, and are commonly used in various programming challenges.
* **Hashing:** Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size array, allowing for efficient retrieval. It's often used in problems related to search, insert, delete, and more.
